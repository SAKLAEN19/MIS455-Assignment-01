            David Warner plans to use the speed of his Ashes adversaries against them in a T20 World Cup showdown shaping as a must-win match for England. <br> Warner answered pre-tournament criticism, which he admitted he has found exasperating, as the veteran helped Australia shake off a rusty start against Oman's cagey attack to anchor a comfortable first-up win.

            Glenn Maxwell begun the campaign with a first-baller against Oman to continue a miserable run of form stretching back to the IPL, but he was victim to an all-time great catch by Aqib Ilyas. The mercurial Maxwell missed Australia's most recent World Cup clash with their Ashes rivals after falling off a golf cart in Ahmedabad during the ODI World Cup last year, and will be eager to make an impact against the familiar foe. With so many right handers in the England line up, it will be fascinating to see how much he bowls, but he showed in India he is as effective against the righties as he is the lefties.

            A low and slow Barbados wicket block that will see heavy traffic in the first round could impact selection thinking for the clash with England. The worn Kensington Oval pitch block that will host its fifth match in a week for Australia's T20 World Cup clash with England may not necessarily suit either of the two teams' blistering pace attacks.
            That's the opinion of Marcus Stoinis, the all-round star from his side's tournament-opening win over Oman as he came to terms with the capricious Barbados surface better than any other player through three matches there so far.
